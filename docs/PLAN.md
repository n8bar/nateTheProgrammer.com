## Project Overview
- Resume site + internet playground for nateTheProgrammer (n8).
- Primary goal: showcase work, make it easy to contact, and leave a strong visual impression.

## Content Sources
- Resume baseline: LinkedIn export, excluding non-IT roles.
- Exclude older/borderline roles (Reliance Electric, Tricom Systems Engineer, Western Precision).
- Use Tricom Communications Services Web Application Developer role only.
- Red Oak role listed as I.T. only (no estimator duties).
- Site copy will be a fresh rewrite; LinkedIn text is reference only.
- Reference file: `.cybercreek/LinkedInSummary1.md` (untracked).
- Education: list the BS in Software Development only (omit GED and high school).
- Blog is optional and not planned into IA/MVP until explicitly confirmed.

## Constraints
- Fast load times and accessibility as first-class requirements.
- Content should be easy to update without touching core layout/visual systems.
