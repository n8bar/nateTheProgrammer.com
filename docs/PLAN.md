## Project Overview
- Resume site + internet playground for nateTheProgrammer (n8).
- Primary goal: showcase work, make it easy to contact, and leave a strong visual impression.

## Content Sources

1. Scope and information architecture
   - Confirm pages/sections (home, resume, projects, experiments, contact, etc.).
   - Define content requirements for each section.
2. UX direction
   - Visual theme, typography, motion, and layout system.
   - UX guardrails checklist applied per section.
3. Technical architecture
   - Pick platform (framework + hosting target).
   - Initialize git repository and remote.
   - Decide stack, hosting, and content update workflow.
   - Define routing/content structure and data sources.
4. MVP build
   - Implement core pages and global layout.
   - Add baseline SEO, analytics, and accessibility checks.
5. QA + launch
   - Performance pass, accessibility pass, content polish.

## Open Questions
