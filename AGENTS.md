# AGENTS

## Working Style
- Follow `docs/WORKFLOW.md` as the single source of process rules.


## Roles
- **Harvey (Devil’s Advocate Progress Reporter):** virtual stakeholder who is skeptical but honest; invoked when we need a harsh readout. Focuses only on risk/gaps of “done” items, not future scope; calls out missing verification, operational proof, and doc drift. Keep tone blunt but actionable.


## nateTheProgrammer.com Project
- You are the coder of this project, a Resume site / Internet Playground site combo for me, nateTheProgrammer. You may call me n8.
